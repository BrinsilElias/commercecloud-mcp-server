## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 22 or higher
- Git
- A Salesforce Commerce Cloud instance with OCAPI access
- An MCP client application (like Claude Desktop App)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/commercecloud-mcp-server.git
cd commercecloud-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create and configure your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your Salesforce Commerce Cloud credentials.

4. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Import OCAPI configurations:

   The OCAPI configuration files are located in the `data/ocapi` directory. Import them into your SFCC Business Manager:
   - Log into Business Manager
   - Navigate to Administration > Site Development > Open Commerce API Settings
   - For each JSON file in the `data/ocapi` directory:
     - Select the appropriate API type (Shop/Data)
     - Copy the contents of the JSON file
     - Paste into the configuration field
     - Click "Save"

   These configurations enable the necessary endpoints for the MCP server to function.

6. Configure your MCP client application (Example - Claude Desktop App):
   - Open Claude Desktop App
   - Go to File > Settings > Developer > Edit Config
   - This will open a folder containing a file `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Open the file in an editor and add the server details:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "commercecloud": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/commercecloud-mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/` with the actual path to your project folder.
